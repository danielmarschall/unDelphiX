# (un)DelphiX

**UnDelphiX**  is the unofficial version of the  [DelphiX](https://delphi.fandom.com/wiki/DelphiX "DelphiX")  library.

DelphiX is a small library for programming in Delphi with DirectX. It was created by Mr. Hiroyuki Hori in Japan. The library includes twelve components and the DirectX 7 headers. See the  [home page](https://web.archive.org/web/20101220185051/http://www.yks.ne.jp:80/~hori/index-e.html)  (on archive.org).

The library was revised to JEDI official DirectX headers and named unDelphiX. See also  [gameDev/UnDelphiX homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20070316003810/http://turbo.gamedev.net:80/undelphix.asp)  (on archive.org)

In 2004 the library was revised (new compilation of DirextX.pas headers) and hardware acceleration was added. The old code can be recompiled with minor changes, but with improved performance.

The new home for the library is  [here](http://www.micrel.cz/Dx). The latest version is  **1.0.22.0**  (last updated in 19 Nov 2023). Main Changes were compatibility for Delphi 12 Athens.

The package contains full library source, DirectX headers and many examples. Installation into IDE Delphi supported too.
